This mod is straightforward—it adds new questions to the Submod called [ExtraGamesSubmod](https://github.com/Dsfan2/ExtraGamesSubmod?tab=readme-ov-file#current-games). The original Submod was created by the talented [Dsfan2](https://github.com/Dsfan2).
The new questions were made with my general knowledge and help of ChatGPT to ensure proper formatting and grammar. This modification keeps the original questions intact while adding more across all question files.
